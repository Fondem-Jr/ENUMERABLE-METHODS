# ENUMERABLE-METHODS

This is the second project we built on Ruby. The script counts with ten functions:
 - my_each.
 - my_each_with_index.
 - my_select
 - my_all?
 - my_any?
 - my_none?
 - my_count
 - my_map
 - my_inject

## Objectives 
The objectives of this project are:
- Learn basic data types, methods, loops and syntaxis for Ruby
- Learn the good prectices for Ruby and how to set up Gemfile
- To understand how the various enumerable methods work. 
- Learn to use the yield keyword 
- Learn to use blocks and procs
- Learn to debug a project file    

## Technologies
- VSCode (editor)
- Ruby (language)
- Git/GitHub (version control)
- Rspec(domain-specific language (DSL)

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- [Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) on your system.
### Setup & Run
 - $ git clone git@github.com:Fondem-Jr/ENUMERABLE-METHODS.git
 - $ cd ./ENUMERABLE-METHODS
 - $ ruby script.rb

## Running tests with Rspec

This game is tested with Rspec(domain-specific language (DSL)) testing tool written in Ruby programming language to test Ruby code. It is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework which is extensively used in production applications.

## How to get Rspec running

- Open the terminal, type `gem install rspec`
- Once rspec installed, you can check for the version using `rspec --version`
- Go to project directory and type `rspec --init` to initialize the rspec in your project
- You will see a folder `spec` and a file `.rspec`
- Inside spec folder you'll see a `spec_helper.rb` file.
- Create your spec files in the spec folder.
- In the terminal, type `rspec` to run the spec file
